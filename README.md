# The maze of Waze 2
Practicing in building a navigation program


## Introduction with the Project
This project is the base of a navigation software,every map can be encoded into graphs. and as we know every graph as nodes and edges.
So this Project has classes that create nodes and edges.
From those classes we created a DGraph that combine the two in a graph.
The next Step is Coding algorithmes such as: finding the shortest path from one spot to another,are two vertices are connected and more...
After that we created Fruit and robot classes to simulate cars and destination for robots(one day theyll become cars) to go to.
Next Step was to create Game_Algo class that is incharge of moving the game in an automatic way to get to as many destinations as possible.
Then we created a GUI for the user so he can work with the software without knowing how to program.
Lastly we created a KML_Logger class that incharge to export all the data to a KML file. 

## The functionality of the program
This is our first try practicing with a few data structures together as well as combining all the data and working with diffrent algorithems to create a good structure for a navigation software. 
The drive option allows the user to choose between driving robots and allowing the computer to run the robots automaticlly.
The GUI is allowing the user the ability to interact with the software in a much more intuative way.
The GUI has a special option to save the data to a kml file.

## Algorithms
The project hold the next algorithms:
1) The Dijkstra algorithms.(finding the "cheaper way from from node to another").
2)Is Connected - checking if two nodes are connected.
3)The salesman problem idea - finding the shortest way between a group fo nodes.
4)Retrieving the length of the shortest path between two nodes.

## GUI 
The GUI Has a few options that enables the user to find all kind of calculations in the graph.
The options that the GUI can do:
1)The GUI can Open a Saved graph file as long as the file is in the same serializable format.
2)The GUI can save graphs as serializable or as png file.
3)The GUi allows to drive the robots manually or Automaticlly.
4)Saving the data to KML

A bonus feature was to simulate the apple as apple logo and the robots as andoid logo'and the android wants to eat apples logo.

## Summary
Thanks for using our software we would like to have any kind of feedback so we can improve our project,and create the ultimative program for navigation.
